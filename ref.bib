To what extent is high quality basic health care guaranteed to all, sufficient to enable them to exercise their basic political rights as adult citizens?
Responses: 
0: Extreme. Because of poor quality health care, at least 75 per cent of citizens  ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined. 
1: Unequal. Because of poor quality health care, at least 25 per cent of citizens  ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined. 
2: Somewhat equal. Because of poor quality health care, 10 25 per cent of citizens  ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined. 
3: Relatively equal. Basic health care overall is equal in quality but because of poor quality health care, 5 10 per cent of citizens  ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined. 
4: Equal. Basic health care is equal in quality and less than 5 per cent of citizens cannot exercise their basic political rights as adult citizens. 
Clarification 
Poor quality health care can leave citizens unable to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens by failing to adequately treat preventable and treatable illnesses that render them unable to work, participate in social or political organizations, or vote (where voting is allowed).},

  abstract = {Researchers are often interested in using longitudinal data to estimate the causal effects of hypothetical time-varying treatment interventions on the mean or risk of a future outcome. Standard regression/conditioning methods for confounding control generally fail to recover causal effects when time-varying confounders are themselves affected by past treatment. In such settings, estimators derived from Robins's g-formula may recover time-varying treatment effects provided sufficient covariates are measured to control confounding by unmeasured risk factors. The package gfoRmula implements in R one such estimator: the parametric g-formula. This estimator easily adapts to binary or continuous time-varying treatments as well as contrasts defined by static or dynamic, deterministic or random treatment interventions, as well as interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment. The package accommodates survival outcomes as well as binary or continuous end of follow-up outcomes. For survival outcomes, the package has different options for handling competing events. This paper describes the gfoRmula package, along with motivating background, features, and examples.},

  abstract = {For structural equation models, a huge variety of fit indices has been developed. These indices, however, can point to conflicting conclusions about the extent to which a model actually matches the observed data. The present article provides some guide-lines that should help applied researchers to evaluate the adequacy of a given struc-tural equation model. First, as goodness-of-fit measures depend on the method used for parameter estimation, maximum likelihood (ML) and weighted least squares (WLS) methods are introduced in the context of structural equation modeling. Then, the most common goodness-of-fit indices are discussed and some recommendations for practitioners given. Finally, we generated an artificial data set according to a "true" model and analyzed two misspecified and two correctly specified models as examples of poor model fit, adequate fit, and good fit. In structural equation modeling (SEM), a model is said to fit the observed data to the extent that the model-implied covariance matrix is equivalent to the empirical co-variance matrix. Once a model has been specified and the empirical covariance matrix is given, a method has to be selected for parameter estimation. Different estimation meth-ods have different distributional assumptions and have different discrepancy functions to be minimized. When the estimation procedure has converged to a reasonable},
